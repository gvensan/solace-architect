# Integration Hub Catalog

Snapshot of available Micro-Integrations, integration guides, and agents from the [Solace Integration Hub](https://solace.com/integration-hub/). Skills use this catalog to match user-identified backend systems against available Micro-Integrations without requiring a live fetch.

**Last refreshed:** 2026-04-29

## How skills use this catalog

1. During `/solace-discovery`: when the user names a backend system, check this catalog for a matching Micro-Integration. If found, note it in the discovery brief.
2. During `/solace-integration`: use this catalog as the starting inventory. For each backend, classify as "cataloged MI available," "custom MI needed," or "integration guide available."
3. During `/solace-validate`: verify that every backend in the architecture has either a cataloged Micro-Integration or a documented custom one.

If a system is not in this catalog, it does not mean no Micro-Integration exists — the catalog may be stale. Direct the user to check `solace.com/integration-hub` for the latest availability.

## Update discipline

This catalog is a point-in-time snapshot. Solace adds new Micro-Integrations regularly. To keep it current:

1. Run `bun run url:check` monthly to verify Integration Hub is reachable.
2. Before any `/solace-integration` engagement, check `solace.com/integration-hub` for new entries.
3. When a skill finds a system not in this catalog but a Micro-Integration exists, add it here and note the date.
4. When a Micro-Integration is retired or renamed, update this catalog.
